# Installation
# The first method that involves getting a local deb repository
# This runfile install the repository locally
# Then, apt-get can be used as normal
# Be wary: nvidia-settings > 352 is needed
# ALSO: cuda brings its own nvidia driver. Yeah.

# The second method is without the package manager:
# Get the runfile installer
# Make sure to uninstall previous nvidia drivers
# so the cuda installer can install its own
